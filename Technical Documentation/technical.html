            <p>Documentation is the product of technical writing that refers to different documents with product-related data and information; it has the details about a technical product that is either under development or already in use. It can be printed
                or online. Technical documentation is created in various industries, for example, in engineering, medicine, IT and so on.</p>
            <p>You may imagine that documentation is just dry text that people with relevant education can read and understand but it’s not true. Nowadays, documentation is more than text — videos, screenshots, charts, diagrams, and other visual elements
                feature modern manuals. You will fully realize it when you look through doc examples below.</p>

            <header>Who Creates Technical Documentation?</header>
            <p>Usually, technical writers create technical documentation with the help of other groups of professionals like SMEs, designers, developers, reviewers. Sometimes, product developers themselves create documentation for their products.</p>

            <header>What is the Purpose of Technical Documentation?
            </header>
            <p>The major reasons why companies today create technical documentation are to reduce customer tickets, the expenses on customer service and enable their support team to solve customer queries effectively. So, the main purpose of technical documentation
                is to help users achieve their goal using the product. It can be in the form of a printed or online manual, video, and the like.</p>

            <p>Documentation can be in different forms — it can be online, printed, interactive, and even in a video format.</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
      alert("Hello" + yourName);
      }
      greetMe("World");</code>

            <p>In spite of the opinion that nobody reads documentation, manuals are helpful and people read them. Of course, you don’t read a manual for your TV because nobody does it until something go wrong. But in a professional sphere, nobody acts like
                this.</p>
            <code>function square(number) {
      return number * number;
    </code>
            <code>return number * number;</code>
            <p>As I’ve said above, documentation is used in various spheres, for example, in medicine. As the technology is developing, there are new medicine devices with accompanying documentation. And, of course, health staff reads it or they are taught
                before implementing.</p>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
      function f(){};
      const f = 5;
      // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO
      function f() {
      const g = 5;
      }
      var g;
      //statements
      }</code>

            <p>I’m a technical writer and I create documentation. This process is not easy but very exciting. You can read about the process of creating manuals here:</p>
            <code>if (true) {
      var x = 5;
      }
      console.log(x); //5</code>
